# Epic 3: AI Synthesis & Anti-Repetition System

**Epic Goal:** Develop the core AI synthesis engine that transforms raw content from multiple sources into connected, personalized insights tailored to each user's knowledge base and professional context. Implement the anti-repetition knowledge tracking system that ensures new content builds upon rather than repeats previously delivered information, creating a progressive learning experience.

## Story 3.1: AI Content Synthesis Engine

As the system,  
I want to process raw content from multiple sources into coherent, personalized insights using AI synthesis,  
so that users receive connected intelligence rather than fragmented information pieces.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. OpenAI API integration with prompt engineering for professional content synthesis
2. Content processing pipeline that combines articles from multiple sources into unified insights
3. User context incorporation including professional background, current tool stack, and interest areas
4. Synthesis quality validation with confidence scoring and error handling for low-quality outputs
5. Source attribution preservation throughout synthesis process for transparency and credibility
6. Batch processing capability to handle daily content volumes efficiently within API rate limits
7. Content categorization and tagging system for organized insight delivery
8. Fallback mechanisms for API failures including content queuing and retry logic

## Story 3.2: User Knowledge Graph & Anti-Repetition System

As a regular user,  
I want the system to remember what content I've previously seen and build upon my growing knowledge,  
so that I receive progressive insights rather than repetitive information.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. User knowledge tracking system that records delivered content, topics, and insight themes
2. Content similarity detection using vector embeddings to identify potential repetition
3. Progressive complexity system that increases insight depth as user knowledge in areas grows
4. Knowledge gap identification to surface areas where user might benefit from foundational content
5. Content relationship mapping showing how new insights connect to previous learning
6. User knowledge visualization dashboard showing learning progress across different domains
7. Anti-repetition threshold configuration allowing users to control novelty vs reinforcement balance
8. Knowledge export functionality for user reference and potential migration

## Story 3.3: Personalized Insight Generation

As a professional user,  
I want to receive AI-synthesized insights that specifically address my professional context and curiosity areas,  
so that the content directly supports my decision-making and professional development needs.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Personalization engine that incorporates user's role, industry, and current challenges into synthesis
2. Insight formatting that highlights key decisions, trends, and action items relevant to user's context
3. Professional impact assessment showing how insights relate to user's work and tool selections
4. Curiosity area deep-dives that explore emerging topics in user's specified interest domains
5. Cross-domain connection discovery that reveals relationships between user's different interest areas
6. Actionable recommendation generation including next steps and follow-up suggestions
7. Insight confidence indicators helping users assess reliability of AI-generated recommendations
8. Professional language and tone appropriate for business decision-making contexts
