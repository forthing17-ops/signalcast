# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish the technical foundation for SignalCast while delivering an initial content discovery interface that demonstrates the platform's professional intelligence concept. This epic provides the essential project infrastructure (authentication, database, deployment) combined with a basic content exploration experience that validates user interest and provides immediate value for early adopters.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup & Development Environment

As a developer,  
I want a fully configured development environment with all necessary tools and frameworks,  
so that I can begin building SignalCast features efficiently with proper code quality and deployment capabilities.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Next.js project initialized with TypeScript configuration and folder structure following established conventions
2. Tailwind CSS integrated and configured with basic design system tokens
3. PostgreSQL database setup locally and in cloud environment with initial schema
4. Authentication system configured using Next.js Auth or similar with user registration/login functionality
5. CI/CD pipeline established for automated testing and deployment to staging environment
6. Basic logging and error monitoring integrated for development debugging
7. Environment configuration management setup for local, staging, and production environments

## Story 1.2: User Authentication & Profile Management

As a professional user,  
I want to create an account and manage my basic profile information,  
so that I can access personalized content and maintain my preferences securely.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. User registration flow with email/password and basic profile information capture
2. Secure login/logout functionality with session management
3. Password reset capability via email verification
4. Basic profile page where users can update email, password, and display name
5. Account deletion functionality with proper data cleanup
6. Email verification system for new account activation
7. Security measures including rate limiting on authentication attempts

## Story 1.3: Content Discovery Interface (MVP)

As a tech professional,  
I want to browse and discover relevant industry content from multiple sources,  
so that I can evaluate whether SignalCast provides value for my professional intelligence needs.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Content discovery page displaying curated tech industry articles from 2-3 sources (Reddit, Product Hunt)
2. Basic categorization or tagging system for content organization (AI, tools, development, etc.)
3. Simple search functionality to find content by keywords or topics
4. Content preview with title, summary, source attribution, and publication date
5. Click-through functionality to original source articles
6. Responsive design working on both desktop and mobile browsers
