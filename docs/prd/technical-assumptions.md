# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing all project components (frontend, backend, AI synthesis engine, data sourcing modules) to enable rapid development, shared tooling, and simplified deployment coordination for MVP development phase.

## Service Architecture

**Microservices within Monorepo:** Separate services for user personalization, content sourcing, AI synthesis, visual formatting, and delivery scheduling that can scale independently while sharing development infrastructure. Services communicate via internal APIs and message queues for batch processing workflows.

**Critical rationale:** This architecture supports the complex data pipeline from sourcing → synthesis → delivery while allowing independent scaling of compute-intensive AI processing versus user-facing web services.

## Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests for business logic, integration tests for AI synthesis accuracy, and end-to-end testing for critical user workflows (onboarding → content delivery). Manual testing convenience for content quality validation due to subjective nature of AI synthesis effectiveness.

**Critical rationale:** AI synthesis quality requires human validation in addition to automated testing, while core platform functionality must be automatically tested for reliability.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Framework:** React/Next.js with TypeScript for type safety and component-based UI, Tailwind CSS for rapid social media-style interface development

**Backend Technology:** Node.js with Express for API services, Python with FastAPI for AI/ML integration and data processing pipelines  

**Database Architecture:** PostgreSQL for user profiles and structured data, Vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate) for content similarity and anti-repetition functionality, Redis for caching personalized content

**AI/ML Integration:** OpenAI APIs for content synthesis, with fallback strategies and quality validation layers due to high-stakes recommendation context

**External API Management:** Rate-limited integrations with Twitter, Reddit, Product Hunt APIs including fallback mechanisms for service disruptions

**Hosting Infrastructure:** Cloud-native approach using AWS or Google Cloud with auto-scaling for batch synthesis processing, CDN for visual content delivery

**Security Requirements:** User data encryption for personalization profiles, API rate limiting, content moderation for AI synthesis, GDPR/CCPA compliance for preference management
