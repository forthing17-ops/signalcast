# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create a professional intelligence consumption experience that feels as engaging as social media browsing while maintaining credibility and focus for business decision-making. The interface should eliminate the "boring newsletter format" problem by presenting synthesized content in visually appealing, scannable chunks that encourage exploration and deeper engagement with relevant insights.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**Social Media-Style Content Flow:** Present content as visual cards with screen captures, highlights, and expandable sections that allow users to control their depth of engagement with each insight.

**Progressive Disclosure:** Start with high-level synthesized insights and allow users to drill down into source materials, related developments, or additional context without losing their place in the main feed.

**Smart Navigation:** Enable fluid movement between related topics and insights through intelligent cross-linking and recommendation systems that respect user's current focus area.

**Feedback-Driven Experience:** Seamlessly integrate rating and preference adjustment mechanisms that don't interrupt content consumption flow but continuously improve personalization.

## Core Screens and Views

**Onboarding Flow:** Multi-step personalization wizard that feels conversational rather than form-heavy, capturing professional interests and content preferences through interactive elements.

**Daily Intelligence Feed:** Primary consumption interface presenting synthesized insights in visual social media-style cards with clear hierarchy and scannable formatting.

**Insight Detail View:** Expanded view of individual insights with source attribution, related developments, and action items or follow-up suggestions.

**Preference Dashboard:** User control center for adjusting interests, managing sources, reviewing personalization history, and controlling delivery preferences.

**Archive/Library:** Organized storage of saved insights with search, tagging, and categorization capabilities for future reference and knowledge building.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensure professional usability across diverse user environments with keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, sufficient color contrast, and text scaling support for extended reading sessions.

## Branding

Adopt Claude's visual design language and aesthetic principles - clean, modern, and professional with subtle orange accent colors. Emphasize readability, clear typography, and minimalist interface elements that prioritize content over decoration. Maintain the approachable yet intelligent feel that builds trust in AI-powered recommendations while ensuring visual consistency with familiar AI assistant interfaces.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop and mobile web responsive design optimized for professional content consumption. Desktop for deep engagement during focused research time, mobile for quick consumption during commutes or brief professional moments.
