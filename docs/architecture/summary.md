# Summary

This architecture provides a simple, fast-to-implement foundation for SignalCast MVP. Key decisions:

- **Single Next.js app** instead of microservices
- **Supabase for everything** (auth, database, storage)
- **Minimal dependencies** (no queues, caches, or complex tools)
- **PostgreSQL text search** instead of vector database for MVP
- **Direct API calls** instead of abstraction layers

This approach allows you to:
- Launch in 4 weeks instead of 4 months
- Test core value proposition quickly
- Iterate based on user feedback
- Scale up architecture when needed

Total estimated setup time: **1 day**
Total estimated development time: **3-4 weeks** for MVP
