# SignalCast Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Deliver hyper-personalized professional intelligence that eliminates research time through intelligent data sourcing and AI synthesis
• Enable informed technology and business decisions for tech professionals facing rapidly evolving landscapes
• Provide connected insights that reveal relationships between industry developments rather than isolated information fragments  
• Build user knowledge systematically through anti-repetition content that builds on previous learning and expertise
• Transform overwhelming information overload into actionable professional intelligence delivered in engaging visual format
• Support diverse professional needs including technology adoption, competitive positioning, market awareness, and strategic planning

### Background Context

SignalCast addresses a critical gap in professional intelligence gathering for tech entrepreneurs, developers, and decision-makers who need to stay current with rapidly evolving technology landscapes. The current information ecosystem forces professionals to manually filter signal from noise across fragmented sources (Twitter, Reddit, newsletters, forums) while trying to make informed decisions about their technology stack, business strategy, and competitive positioning.

Unlike generic news aggregators that broadcast the same recycled content to everyone, SignalCast functions as a personalized intelligence system. The platform combines intelligent data sourcing that knows where different information types live, AI synthesis that connects disparate developments into coherent insights, and visual social media-style presentation that makes professional content consumption engaging rather than the "boring newsletter formats" that feel like "PR documents with no unique insight."

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Create a professional intelligence consumption experience that feels as engaging as social media browsing while maintaining credibility and focus for business decision-making. The interface should eliminate the "boring newsletter format" problem by presenting synthesized content in visually appealing, scannable chunks that encourage exploration and deeper engagement with relevant insights.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Social Media-Style Content Flow:** Present content as visual cards with screen captures, highlights, and expandable sections that allow users to control their depth of engagement with each insight.

**Progressive Disclosure:** Start with high-level synthesized insights and allow users to drill down into source materials, related developments, or additional context without losing their place in the main feed.

**Smart Navigation:** Enable fluid movement between related topics and insights through intelligent cross-linking and recommendation systems that respect user's current focus area.

**Feedback-Driven Experience:** Seamlessly integrate rating and preference adjustment mechanisms that don't interrupt content consumption flow but continuously improve personalization.

### Core Screens and Views

**Onboarding Flow:** Multi-step personalization wizard that feels conversational rather than form-heavy, capturing professional interests and content preferences through interactive elements.

**Daily Intelligence Feed:** Primary consumption interface presenting synthesized insights in visual social media-style cards with clear hierarchy and scannable formatting.

**Insight Detail View:** Expanded view of individual insights with source attribution, related developments, and action items or follow-up suggestions.

**Preference Dashboard:** User control center for adjusting interests, managing sources, reviewing personalization history, and controlling delivery preferences.

**Archive/Library:** Organized storage of saved insights with search, tagging, and categorization capabilities for future reference and knowledge building.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensure professional usability across diverse user environments with keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, sufficient color contrast, and text scaling support for extended reading sessions.

### Branding

Adopt Claude's visual design language and aesthetic principles - clean, modern, and professional with subtle orange accent colors. Emphasize readability, clear typography, and minimalist interface elements that prioritize content over decoration. Maintain the approachable yet intelligent feel that builds trust in AI-powered recommendations while ensuring visual consistency with familiar AI assistant interfaces.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop and mobile web responsive design optimized for professional content consumption. Desktop for deep engagement during focused research time, mobile for quick consumption during commutes or brief professional moments.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing all project components (frontend, backend, AI synthesis engine, data sourcing modules) to enable rapid development, shared tooling, and simplified deployment coordination for MVP development phase.

### Service Architecture

**Microservices within Monorepo:** Separate services for user personalization, content sourcing, AI synthesis, visual formatting, and delivery scheduling that can scale independently while sharing development infrastructure. Services communicate via internal APIs and message queues for batch processing workflows.

**Critical rationale:** This architecture supports the complex data pipeline from sourcing → synthesis → delivery while allowing independent scaling of compute-intensive AI processing versus user-facing web services.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests for business logic, integration tests for AI synthesis accuracy, and end-to-end testing for critical user workflows (onboarding → content delivery). Manual testing convenience for content quality validation due to subjective nature of AI synthesis effectiveness.

**Critical rationale:** AI synthesis quality requires human validation in addition to automated testing, while core platform functionality must be automatically tested for reliability.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Framework:** React/Next.js with TypeScript for type safety and component-based UI, Tailwind CSS for rapid social media-style interface development

**Backend Technology:** Node.js with Express for API services, Python with FastAPI for AI/ML integration and data processing pipelines  

**Database Architecture:** PostgreSQL for user profiles and structured data, Vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate) for content similarity and anti-repetition functionality, Redis for caching personalized content

**AI/ML Integration:** OpenAI APIs for content synthesis, with fallback strategies and quality validation layers due to high-stakes recommendation context

**External API Management:** Rate-limited integrations with Twitter, Reddit, Product Hunt APIs including fallback mechanisms for service disruptions

**Hosting Infrastructure:** Cloud-native approach using AWS or Google Cloud with auto-scaling for batch synthesis processing, CDN for visual content delivery

**Security Requirements:** User data encryption for personalization profiles, API rate limiting, content moderation for AI synthesis, GDPR/CCPA compliance for preference management
