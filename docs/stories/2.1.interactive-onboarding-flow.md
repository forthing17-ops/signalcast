## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3 completion:
- Supabase Auth 2.0+ with SSR package fully operational for authenticated routes
- User model and Prisma client established with user.onboarded boolean field available
- shadcn/ui design system components integrated and ready for form components
- React Hook Form with Zod validation patterns established for form handling
- Testing infrastructure with Vitest, Playwright, and React Testing Library configured

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2+ with app directory structure for onboarding pages
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with Prisma 5.0+ ORM for UserPreferences model
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui components for form elements, buttons, and layout
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4+ utility-first styling for responsive onboarding design
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form 7.0+ with Zod validation for multi-step forms
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth 2.0+ for protecting onboarding route

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**User Model Extensions:**
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string | null;
  created_at: Date;
  onboarded: boolean;  // Set to true after onboarding completion
}
```

**UserPreferences Model Structure:**
```typescript
interface UserPreferences {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;           // Foreign key to User
  interests: string[];       // Technology interests array
  tech_stack: string[];      // Current technologies used
  delivery_time: string;     // Preferred delivery time in "HH:MM" format
  content_depth: 'brief' | 'detailed';  // Content depth preference
  professional_role: string;            // Job role/title
  industry: string;                     // Industry sector
  company_size: string;                 // Company size category
  experience_level: string;             // Professional experience level
  curiosity_areas: string[];           // Emerging topics to track
  delivery_frequency: string;          // How often to receive content
  content_formats: string[];           // Preferred content types
}
```

**Relationships:**
- UserPreferences belongs to one User (user_id → user.id)
- Each user has one UserPreferences record created during onboarding

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#preferences-endpoints]
**Required Onboarding API Endpoints:**
```typescript
GET    /api/preferences          // Get existing user preferences (for resume)
POST   /api/preferences          // Create new preferences during onboarding
PUT    /api/preferences          // Update preferences (for partial saves)
```

**Onboarding Preferences Request Format:**
```typescript
{
  "interests": ["AI", "React", "TypeScript", "Next.js"],
  "tech_stack": ["JavaScript", "PostgreSQL", "Docker"],
  "delivery_time": "09:00",
  "content_depth": "detailed",
  "professional_role": "Senior Developer",

    // ... all preference fields
  }
}
```
