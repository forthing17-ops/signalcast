DELETE /api/user/account         // Delete user account
```

**Profile Update Request Format:**
```typescript
{
  email?: string;     // Optional email update
  name?: string;      // Optional display name update
  password?: string;  // Optional password update

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-25

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation with enterprise-grade security practices.** The authentication system demonstrates strong adherence to security best practices with comprehensive input validation, rate limiting, and proper session management. All 7 acceptance criteria have been thoroughly implemented with appropriate test coverage.

**Key Strengths:**
- Comprehensive input sanitization with XSS prevention
- Rate limiting implementation with token bucket algorithm
- Strong password validation with common password checking
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout (no `any` types except in tests)
- Security headers applied to all API responses
- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated security utilities

**Minor Improvement Opportunity:**
- Rate limiter token refill logic could be optimized (see refactoring below)

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `lib/rate-limit.ts`
  - **Change**: Optimized token refill calculation in `refillTokens` method
  - **Why**: The current implementation adds tokens based on time intervals but doesn't properly reset the lastRefill timestamp to account for partial intervals
  - **How**: Fixed the refill timestamp calculation to prevent token accumulation issues

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ All critical rules followed
  - Supabase Auth used exclusively (no custom auth)
  - React Hook Form with Zod validation implemented
  - Proper TypeScript interfaces throughout
  - Server Components by default with 'use client' only where needed
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect adherence to architecture
  - App directory structure used correctly
  - API routes properly organized
  - Components follow naming conventions
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage
  - Unit tests for utilities and components
  - API route tests with proper mocking
  - E2E tests covering critical user flows
  - Security-focused test scenarios included
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

All critical items have been addressed:

- [x] ✅ Registration flow with email verification
- [x] ✅ Secure login/logout with session management
- [x] ✅ Password reset via email
- [x] ✅ Profile management page
- [x] ✅ Account deletion with confirmation
- [x] ✅ Email verification system

**Future Enhancements (Non-blocking):**
- [ ] Consider adding CAPTCHA for additional bot protection
- [ ] Implement session timeout warnings for better UX
- [ ] Add audit logging for security events
- [ ] Consider moving rate limiting to Redis for production scalability

### Security Review

**PASS** - Excellent security implementation:
- Input sanitization prevents XSS attacks
- SQL injection protection through Prisma ORM
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- Security headers protect against common vulnerabilities
- Password strength validation with common password detection
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- CSRF protection through Supabase Auth

### Performance Considerations

**PASS** - Well-optimized for current scale:
- In-memory rate limiting suitable for MVP (needs Redis for scale)
- Efficient token bucket algorithm with O(1) operations
- Proper cleanup of old rate limit entries
- Minimal database queries with appropriate indexing
- Client-side validation reduces unnecessary API calls
