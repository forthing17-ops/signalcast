From Story 2.1 completion:
- UserPreferences model fully established with comprehensive fields
- Preferences API endpoints (GET/POST/PUT) operational at `/api/preferences`
- React Hook Form + Zod validation patterns working for complex forms
- shadcn/ui components integrated for consistent preference UI components
- Progress persistence patterns established for multi-step interfaces

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2+ with app directory structure for preferences pages
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with Prisma 5.0+ ORM for UserPreferences management
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui components for forms, tabs, toggles, and data display
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4+ utility-first styling for responsive preference interfaces
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form 7.0+ with Zod validation for preference forms
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth 2.0+ for protecting preference routes

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**Existing UserPreferences Model:**
```typescript
interface UserPreferences {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  interests: string[];
  tech_stack: string[];
  delivery_time: string; // "HH:MM" format
  content_depth: 'brief' | 'detailed';
  professional_role: string;
  industry: string;
  company_size: string;
  experience_level: string;
  curiosity_areas: string[];
  delivery_frequency: string;
  content_formats: string[];
}
```

**New PreferenceHistory Model Required:**
```typescript
interface PreferenceHistory {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  field_changed: string;
  old_value: any;
  new_value: any;
  changed_at: Date;
  change_reason?: string;
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#preferences-endpoints]
**Existing Preference Endpoints:**
```typescript
GET    /api/preferences          // Get current preferences
PUT    /api/preferences          // Update preferences
```

**New Endpoints Required:**
```typescript
GET    /api/preferences/history          // Get preference change history
POST   /api/preferences/import           // Import preferences from file
GET    /api/preferences/export           // Export preferences to JSON
POST   /api/preferences/preview          // Generate content preview
```

### File Locations and Project Structure
[Source: architecture/project-structure.md]
**Preferences Pages:**
- Main Preferences: `app/(app)/preferences/page.tsx`
- Section routing: `app/(app)/preferences/[section]/page.tsx` (if using dynamic routing)

**API Routes:**
- Preference History: `app/api/preferences/history/route.ts`
- Import/Export: `app/api/preferences/import/route.ts`, `app/api/preferences/export/route.ts`
- Preview: `app/api/preferences/preview/route.ts`

**Components:**
- Preferences Layout: `components/preferences/preferences-layout.tsx`
- Section Components: `components/preferences/{section}-section.tsx`
- Shared Components: `components/preferences/preference-card.tsx`, `components/preferences/change-tracker.tsx`

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/security-considerations.md#mvp-security-checklist]
- ✅ All preference routes protected by Supabase Auth middleware
- ✅ Validate all preference updates with Zod schemas
- ✅ Use Row Level Security (RLS) for UserPreferences and PreferenceHistory access
- ✅ Sanitize imported preference data to prevent injection attacks
- ✅ Rate limiting on preference update APIs to prevent spam modifications

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules-for-ai-development]
- Use Prisma client for all UserPreferences and PreferenceHistory operations
- Type everything with TypeScript interfaces (no `any` types)
- Use app directory structure for preference pages
- Server Components by default, 'use client' only for form interactions
- Validate all form inputs with Zod schemas before submission
- Use React Hook Form for complex preference forms
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns and Tailwind CSS only

## Testing

- Test import/export functionality with various data formats
- Validate real-time preview updates when preferences change
- Test responsive design for preference management on all devices
- Verify API integration for all new preference endpoints
- Test error handling for network failures and invalid preference data

### Test File Locations

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-25

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates strong architecture with comprehensive UI components and proper separation of concerns. React Hook Form integration is well-implemented with proper TypeScript typing throughout. The code follows established patterns from previous stories with consistent shadcn/ui component usage.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review. The code quality is solid and follows established patterns.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows TypeScript best practices, proper component structure
- Project Structure: ✓ Uses app directory, proper component organization  
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Test issues identified - some test failures in component tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria implemented with comprehensive functionality

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Fix failing component tests (PreferencesLayout multiple element issue)
- [ ] Add proper database schema migration for PreferenceHistory model (currently mock data)
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries for preference loading failures
- [ ] Add E2E tests for complete preference management workflows
- [ ] Consider implementing preference validation schemas with Zod
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all mock data structures

### Security Review

Authentication properly implemented using Supabase auth middleware. All preference routes are protected. Input validation appears adequate but could be enhanced with Zod schemas. No obvious security vulnerabilities detected.

### Performance Considerations

Components use proper React patterns with useState and useEffect. Real-time preview functionality is well-architected. Consider memoization for complex preference calculations in production.

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during the review process.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/2.2-user-preference-management-system.yml

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - Address test failures and implement proper database schema before production deployment
