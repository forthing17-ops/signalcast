### Database Schema
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
Initial Prisma schema must include:

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules-for-ai-development]
- Use Prisma for all database operations (no raw SQL)
- Type everything (no `any` types)
- Use app directory structure (not /pages)
- Server Components by default ('use client' only when needed)
- Validate environment variables with zod at startup
- Consistent API JSON structure with error handling
- Use Supabase Auth (no custom auth logic)
- Tailwind only (no custom CSS except globals.css)

### File Naming Conventions
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#file-naming-conventions]
- Components: PascalCase (`ContentCard.tsx`)
- Utilities: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)
- API Routes: kebab-case folders (`/api/user-profile/route.ts`)
- Types: PascalCase with 'I' prefix for interfaces (`IUser`)

### Deployment Configuration
[Source: architecture/deployment.md#vercel-deployment]
- Deploy using Vercel CLI
- Configure cron jobs in vercel.json for future content processing
- Enable Vercel Analytics automatically
- Monitor functions and errors through Vercel Dashboard

### Testing Standards
